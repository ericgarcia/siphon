# Siphon

**🇬🇧 English** · [🇫🇷 Français](README.fr.md)

> A fork of [spotify/portal-ai-plugins](https://github.com/spotify/portal-ai-plugins),
> **adapted to run without Spotify Portal**. Same idea, same prompts, same results,
> but it talks straight to the Google AI Studio (Gemini) API, so you only need an API key.

Most of what a coding agent does is not thinking. It is I/O. Siphon intercepts the
expensive part and sends it to a cheap worker model:

- **bulk-reader**: read many or large files and answer one question about them
- **code-writer**: generate boilerplate that matches your existing files

Measured on this repo's own fixtures: a 602-line file costs **12,006 tokens** to read
directly, versus **137 tokens** for the answer that comes back: **98% less context**,
in about 2 seconds for roughly half a cent.

Works in **Claude Code**, and ships manifests for **Codex** and **Cursor**.

## Quick start

**1. Get an API key** at [aistudio.google.com/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey):

```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-key"
```

**2. Install it in your agent.**

Claude Code:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add BenjaminPolge/siphon
claude plugin install siphon@siphon-plugins
```

Codex:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add BenjaminPolge/siphon
codex plugin add siphon@siphon-plugins
```

Cursor: copy or symlink `plugins/siphon` into `~/.cursor/plugins/local/siphon/`, then
enable it under **Settings → Customize → Plugins**. Cursor asks for the API key itself
at install time, so it never touches a file.

**3. Start a new session** and run:

```text
/siphon:setup
```

That's it. From then on, any attempt to read a file over 350 lines is blocked and
redirected to Gemini automatically.

Something not working? Run `/siphon:doctor`, which is read-only and spends no tokens.

## What changed from the original

The original required a Spotify Portal instance and its CLI, with the worker model
chosen server-side. This fork removes that dependency entirely.

| | Original | Siphon |
|---|---|---|
| Transport | `portal-cli actions aika:invoke-chat` | direct HTTPS to `generativelanguage.googleapis.com` |
| Requirement | a Portal instance + auth | a Gemini API key |
| Worker prompts | server-side "AiKA modes" | plain text files in `prompts/`, editable |
| Model | chosen by the instance | `SIPHON_MODEL`, default `gemini-3.8-flash` |
| Request size | 120 KB (the prompt travelled through `argv`) | ~1M tokens |
| Hosts | Claude Code | Claude Code, Codex, Cursor |
| Portal catalog workflows | `search`, `service`, `actions`, `feedback` | removed: they query a Backstage catalog no API can replace |

The three-layer design, the two worker prompts (copied verbatim), the command-line
interface and the one-shot-per-call rule are all unchanged. This is a change of
plumbing, not of design.

Beyond the port, three bugs inherited from the original are fixed: benchmarks
reported a flawless 100% saving when the transport failed; the shell gate failed
**open** on any path containing a space; and `grep` walked straight past the gate.

## How it works

Three layers, from hard gate to soft suggestion:

1. **Hooks** block reads that would dump a large file into context.
2. **Scripts** make the Gemini call and clean up the output.
3. **Skills** tell the agent when and how to delegate.

The agent never assembles a pipeline from prose; it calls a script with named arguments.

### What actually works, per host

| Layer | Claude Code | Codex | Cursor |
|---|---|---|---|
| Hook on file reads | ✅ | ❌ no `Read` tool exists | ❓ |
| Hook on shell reads | ✅ | ❌ see below | ❓ |
| Scripts | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Skills | ✅ | ✅ | ❓ |

**Claude Code is verified end to end**: the hook blocks, the skill fires, and the
delegation runs.

**On Codex, the hooks do not fire.** Tested on codex-cli 0.154.0: `SessionStart` runs,
but `PreToolUse` never does, even with a catch-all `*` matcher and an absolute command
path. Codex documents the event, so this may be a version gap rather than a design
choice. Until it changes, Codex gets the skills and the scripts but **no hard gate**:
delegation depends on the agent choosing it. Codex also has no `Read` tool, so even a
working hook would only cover shell reads.

**Cursor is untested.** The manifests follow its documentation, but nothing here has
been run against a live install.

## Requirements

- [`jq`](https://jqlang.org): `brew install jq`
- `curl`: ships with macOS
- A Google AI Studio API key

> **Where your code goes.** Delegated files are sent to Google's public API under your
> own key. If you are used to an internally operated endpoint, this is a change of
> destination for your source code, not just of transport. Check it fits your
> organisation's policy first.

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | - | API key |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY_FILE` | `~/.config/siphon/gemini.key` | Read when the variable is unset |
| `SIPHON_MODEL` | `gemini-3.8-flash` | Model for delegated calls |
| `SIPHON_MIN_LINES` | `350` | Line count above which a read is blocked |
| `SIPHON_HOOK_FAIL_OPEN` | `1` | Allow a blocked read when Gemini cannot serve the delegation. `0` blocks regardless |
| `SIPHON_PEEK_LINES` | `50` | An explicit count at or below this is a peek, not a bulk read |
| `SIPHON_THINKING_BUDGET` | `0` | Gemini reasoning budget (see below) |
| `SIPHON_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | `180` | Per-call ceiling |

### Why reasoning is asked to be off

Gemini Flash models reason by default, and those tokens are billed as output **and drawn
from the same budget as the answer**. Worker tasks gain nothing from it, so Siphon asks for
none.

**How far it gets depends on the model, not on the parameter.** `SIPHON_THINKING_BUDGET=0`
is sent as `thinkingConfig.thinkingBudget`, a Gemini 2.5 parameter. Gemini 3 documents
`thinkingConfig.thinkingLevel` (`minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`) instead and accepts
`thinkingBudget` only for backwards compatibility, and **no Gemini 3 model can turn thinking
off entirely**: `minimal` is the floor, and not every model has `minimal`.

Measured 2026-09-27 on one paid key, same 16-token prompt. Thinking tokens:

| Model | Default | `thinkingBudget: 0` | Explicit `thinkingLevel` |
|---|---|---|---|
| `gemini-3.8-flash` | 134 | 34 | 34 at `low`; **HTTP 400** at `minimal` |
| `gemini-3.6-flash` | 166 | 0 | 0 at `minimal` |
| `gemini-3.5-flash-lite` | 0 | - | 0 at `minimal` |

So `thinkingBudget: 0` already resolves to the lowest level each model allows, which is why
Siphon keeps sending it. `gemini-3.8-flash` cannot go below `low` and so always spends some
thinking; `gemini-3.6-flash` reaches zero. On a real 400-line `bulk-read` requiring arithmetic
across the file, both answered correctly, and 3.6 spent 0 thinking tokens against 3.8's 90 and
158 across two runs.

Because Siphon sets no output cap, this costs tokens rather than truncating the answer, and
the per-call line reports it as `(+N thinking)`. Set `SIPHON_THINKING_BUDGET=-1` to let the
model decide explicitly.

## What doesn't get delegated

- **Debugging**: needs real reasoning, not a summary
- **Editing**: the agent needs exact content; use a targeted read
- **Architectural decisions**: judgment stays with the main model

## Development

```bash
bash plugins/siphon/evals/run.sh              # 86 checks, no key, no network
bash plugins/siphon/evals/run.sh --benchmark  # adds the real round trip
```
